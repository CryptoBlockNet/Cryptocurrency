Rime Coin Core integration/staging repository
=================================================

Rime Coin (RIM) is a sustainable cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Rime Coin utilizes the Green Protocol, an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm inspired by DASH, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

[Rim Core](http://rimecoin.io) is the original Rim client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Rim transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 50,000 RIM.
